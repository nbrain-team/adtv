# Facebook Automation - Fully Functional Database Setup

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Setup
- Created a local SQLite database (`backend/local_test.db`) for testing
- Added database initialization scripts that:
  - Create all necessary tables
  - Create a test user (danny@nbrain.ai / password123)
  - Seed the database with realistic realtor data

### 2. Mock Data Created
- **3 Realtor Clients**:
  - Sarah Johnson - Premier Real Estate
  - Mike Chen - Luxury Homes Specialist  
  - The Davis Team - Your Local Experts
- **45 Facebook Posts** (15 per client) with realistic realtor content
- **24 Ad Campaigns** (8 per client) with performance metrics
- **168 Analytics Records** (7 days of data per campaign)
- **3 Ad Templates** for common realtor scenarios

### 3. Frontend Enhancements
- Added **recharts** library for professional charts and graphs
- Updated Analytics Dashboard with:
  - Line charts for performance trends
  - Pie charts for demographics
  - Bar charts for device usage
  - Real-time metrics visualization
- Added "All Clients" view to see aggregate data
- Client filtering to view individual client data
- "Add New Client" functionality

### 4. Backend Updates
- Modified services to use database data instead of always generating mock data
- API endpoints now serve real persisted data
- Proper database relationships between users, clients, posts, campaigns, and analytics
