I am just finishing up a remodel on a home we own.  Being in real estate, I am sure you guys know the horror stories of tenants. This may just be one of them :-) 
My primary area I serve is Madison, Wisconsin and surrounding areas. I usually will travel up to 90 minutes from where I live in Waunakee which is just outside of Madison. Waunakee itself is a very unique community, which is why it's the ""Only Waunakee in the World"". I can tell you more later. 
What makes me unique from others is this is actually my first year being full time in real estate!  Don't worry Craig and team..  I was active duty at the Wisconsin Air National Guard and retired in March of this year. While being on active duty, I built my real estate business, and managed being full-time in the military and consistently being in the top 5-10% in our local MLS. In RE I focus on veterans, we teach at pre/post deployment events, host education seminars, and really do whatever we can to help the military members know and understand their benefits. We also give back a portion of our commission to military, police, fire, medical professionals, teachers, etc through the Homes for Heroes program. Patrick Johnson from Pewaukee is actually a part of the same program. Not sure if he is still with you guys or not.
That's just a few random tidbits about me, and what makes me unique. The only question I have is on production.

My roots go back over 100 years in Prescott, and so I really do feel like it is an incredibly special place with so much to offer. That's probably why it's growing so much. Needless to say, you can count me in as a super strong ""1"" at this point. I would just like the opportunity to chat through everything with my husband tonight.I would absolutely want to bring my family in some way, as my husband and kids are a huge part of why I do what I do! Prescott has really built a reputation as a ""retirement"" town over the past couple decades... And it really is a fantastic place to retire. But the truth is that there is a vibrant community of young families here as well, and Prescott has so much to offer young families. I would love to showcase some of that, and would relish the opportunity to highlight why my husband and I have decided to stick around and raise our 2 young girls here as well! I want to help spread the word. ""Prescott's not just for old folks!!!!!!!!"" ;)  I can't thank you enough for affording me the opportunity to be considered in all this. Even if nothing else should come of it... (if I'm not chosen as a host etc) I was really motivated by the meeting. I am an agent who thrives on, and has built my business upon the foundation of forging strong relationships; But I'll be the first to admit that capitalizing on media is not something I have put nearly enough effort into, and hasn't translated for me. So I'm feeling very inspired, and I'd just like to thank you for that. You'll be hearing more from me soon, and again, thank you so much for the opportunity! 1/25 Hi there! Thanks so much for the follow up… I loved the meeting, and I am super pumped about the show, and really feel like it would be a great fit for my business, and more importantly, my passion about my hometown!! I already have lots of ideas, But as I'm sure you can imagine I feel like I need to have a chance to chat about it with my husband this evening!!!

Is every episode/season on all of the different streaming services/platforms? Is there any guarantee on the show being on any of the streaming services or just your website?

The docusign link I received does not work. Can you please forward to me so I can review?
When does the contract and therefore payments take effect? Does it start November 1? or when the contract is signed?
I do understand this is a good opportunity to leverage the show to gain networking opportunities and leads. I just want to make sure I understand exactly what I would be talking to people about and what is included.

The biggest reasons right now are:

To vet the outcome agents are seeing in your network from the most successful to the ones who are struggling to find out why they are either succeeding or not getting the traction they had hoped to. 
If I decide right now is not the right time and I do see value in the opportunity, what is the process to revisit this down the road, when the timing might be better on my end? 
Also, would I have time for my attorney to review the media agreement, prior to signing it?

How long till the average agent sees an affect on their business?
Is there any form of coaching that goes along with this or best practices?
What Emmy award has the show been nominated for?
When would the first segment be recorded if I am accepted?

Are those real emails or automated? 4/6 f/up text sent 4/5 Attended QA 4/5 Thank you for inviting us to meet with you yesterday! Jeff and I are a 2. 

Here are some of the questions we have (Craig, I sent these in a reply to you this a.m.)

• Segment questions - do each of the recordings make it to the “show” or is it edited video for us to repurpose? 
• In 12 months, is it a total of 6 segments? 
• In the FB Group, I noticed there were Orlando agents in there that once were on the show but no longer are. Is membership in that group forever?
• Excuse the boldness in this one - American Dream TV Network shows as a Real estate page on FB, why not a media company? Any plans on getting the verified blue checkmark? I was looking at this from an outsider's point of view and wondered why it’s not elevated like a TV/news channel would be.
• Please excuse this one too - some of the videos I came across had bits of awkwardness come through. Do we see the video before it’s released with final edits?

However I can tell you I'm in a big transition right now with rebranding AND I just signed up with a company to help with recruiting and that is ALREADY got my budget VERY TIGHT. ESPECIALLY with this market being not so great and losing like $5mill in deals two weeks ago. I've got to get some things in order before adding anything else right now. I WILL say however, I'm working with a few builders in some BIG projects that are not common property and I think this could add value in getting those out there when it's time to market. So I'm not sure what the protocol is for future opportunities with you guys but please let me know.",,Agent,Jacksonville,Kira,Sikes,Sandbar Realty Llc,904-204-9395,brokerks@sandbarrealtyjax.com,#43 Jacksonville,$69.00,7/19/2024,Dragnet,,,,,,,NEW

He is a paramedic-firefighter and will be home tomorrow morning (48 hours shifts). My questions: what is the monthly cost at my expense? Can this change over time is it is a set cost?

While we believe that $1,000 a month is a fair rate for the services provided, we recognize that with only one clip aired every other month, the total investment could amount to $2,000 for our feature.
One of my partners is associated with a production company that leases from us, giving us the capability to create our own content. We are currently collaborating with The Production House on a renovation project at our new office, where we are transforming 16 dorm rooms into Airbnb units and restoring the main house.
That said, we believe we can provide a unique perspective on the real estate landscape in Syracuse. Although the city is not typically recognized as a luxury market, it presents significant investment opportunities. If there is a way to leverage our existing production resources, we would be open to exploring that possibility. 
Additionally, we are aware that you subcontract videographers, and we would be more than happy to connect you with The Production House, regardless of our participation in the show.

My name is Mindy Wardlaw, and I am a seasoned real estate agent with over 27 years of experience in the vShreveport Bossier area. I am writing to express my interest in being considered for your TV/marketing series to showcase the best that our city has to offer.
Having dedicated my career to promoting the positive aspects of Shreveport Bossier, I am deeply passionate about highlighting the rich cultural heritage, diverse attractions, and quality of life that we have. From our festivals and Mardi Gras celebrations to our acclaimed Rose Center, museums, parks, wildlife centers, and more, there is no shortage of unique experiences waiting to be shared with a wider audience.
I firmly believe that my extensive knowledge of the area, combined with my enthusiasm for showcasing its hidden gems and lesser-known treasures, would make the program filled with great content for us both!  I have a wonderful reputation in the local market and a strong presence in the community, I am confident in my ability to engage viewers and inspire them to explore all that Shreveport Bossier has to offer.

By featuring me on your TV series, you would not only be providing a platform for me to share my insights and expertise but also giving viewers a firsthand look at the features available in our city. Whether it's discussing the low cost of living, top-rated schools, or the exciting revitalization efforts spearheaded by notable figures like 50 Cent, I am eager to showcase the unique appeal of Shreveport Bossier on the program.   I feel it will help propel me to another level of recognition and marketing to the area and my real estate business along with wonderful content for you.  My daughter has also recently joined me and as a young Realtor and a seasoned agent, I feel we would reach a number of markets! 

I am excited about the possibility of collaborating with your team, and confident that my commitment to promoting the best of our city would make for great marketing and television content.

Would I be able to incorporate my real estate partner (team member) in my shoots? Does the monthly “licensing fee” include the videographer, editing, etc……basically the production aspect of each shoot.  I thought I heard Craig say yes but didn’t see it in the agreement.

You can read more about me and testimonials on my website at: SuzyOsum.Shorewest.com

I started selling real estate in our Wauwatosa, WI office but have worked out of our Shorewest Realtors-Waukesha West office for the past 17 years.  I have listed and sold in all surrounding Counties but mainly work in Waukesha County although I currently have a listing on the East side in Milwaukee 2 blocks from Lake Park/Lake Michigan.  I grew up in Minneapolis, MN so I'm a Midwest girl and grew up speedskating on frozen lakes but also lived in IL near St.Louis, MO, and Germany when my husband was on active duty and Reserves as a Pilot in the Air Force, he retired from the Air Force after 32 years and is retiring next year from American Airlines.  I have competed in speedskating and set a world record in the Masters International competition in my age division and am working on getting back in shape to compete in Masters competitions again since the Masters International world sprints will be held in Milwaukee in February 2025.  Milwaukee is 1 of only 2 indoor 400-meter speedskating ovals, the 2nd is in Salt Lake City, Utah where they had the Winter Olympics in 2002.  I thought it would be fun to show the Pettit speedskating oval and interview Bonnie Blair, the most decorated winter Olympic woman with 5 gold medals and 1 bronze.  Her husband is also an Olympian and they are coaching their daughter to try to make the next Olympic team and they started the DASH Team.  I see them when I skate in the mornings at the Pettit and she agreed to do a ""shout-out"" video for the 2nd Annual Veterans Family Ball that I'm co-chair for the event.  Last year my son was able to get us a 20-second celebrity shout-out for the veterans from Dolly Parton that we played at the Inaugural event.  I started in Real Estate to gain knowledge about buying our first home and found out I was good at it, enjoyed it, and I love helping people and wanted a semi-flexible schedule for our 2 kids since my husband is a Pilot and also has an irregular schedule.  Our daughter Marie Osum graduated this year from Belmont in Nashville with a music business degree and is pursuing singing right now and has recently released a song called ""I Know It All"" and our son graduated with a film degree at Columbia and works at CTK in Nashville and films/edits for Dolly Parton and other talent.  He edited one of Dolly's music videos with Linda Perry from her rock album last year and he makes a lot of sizzle reels too.  Most of my business comes from past clients and referrals but thought this might be good to boost my business for new referrals and push me into doing more videos which I know I should be doing to market myself more on social media.  I'm always in the top % in my office and have been the #1 agent in my office but trying to find more balance to be able to work out/train for speedkating in the mornings.  6/18 Yes I was just typing a reply now :-) 6/18 f/up text",,Agent,Waukesha,Suzy,Osum,"Shorewest Realtors, Inc.",(414) 915-8908,sosum@shorewest.com,38 - Milwaukee,8.00,"Tuesday, June 18th at 1p Central",,,,,,,,NEW

This is Perry Guirau, a Native Milwaukeen from the heart of America’s 3rd Coast also known as the Coastal Midwest!
Of course my answer is I am a 1🥇😎.
After doing my homework leading up to today’s zoom interview, it is a no brainer to say yes to this opportunity. It’s already something that my team leader, Kevin Garde CEO of Enlighten Realty Group powered by Keller Williams MKE, and I, are already doing on a monthly basis.
We completely understand that you must have a social media presence, along with a raving fan base, in order to have a strong presence in the market place. We also understand that social media market is absolutely essential in order to not only survive, but more importantly thrive in the Real Estate Industry.
I always tell Kevin, I do not want to be the Next Blockbuster! Where we are well know in the industry one day, but then the next day we are now extinct & an archaic form of business, because we didn’t want to change and adapt with the trend of how business is done today, and how business will be done in the near future.
I want to say even if I am not chosen, that I am humbly honored that I was even considered out of over 9,000 agents and have even made it this far of being one of 1100 potential candidates to make it to the next round.
I am a firm believer that authenticity is so important in every day life. Being a Realtor in the industry,  not only are we a voice for our local community, and an example of how the masses view us, but more importantly we are to be an Ambassador of the People & the city that we live in.
I am Proud to say that I was born and raised in Milwaukee. My family and I are deeply rooted here. I made sure that for today’s zoom interview with you guys, I intentionally chose to hang out at the journeyman hotel. The reason being is that where this hotel currently stands, use to be where my great grandfather’s industrial fastener distribution business use to be. Many people don’t know that my great grandfather had the exclusive business relationship with the Allen Bradley Family to be the only industrial fastener distributor whose gears are what operate the Allen Bradley Clock, which until the early 2000s was the largest four faced clock in the world, and is currently still the largest four faced clock in the US. So yes, when I say my family has deep roots here in Milwaukee, I truly mean it 😁
I have a passion of being a voice of Milwaukee to share it’s history, and why Milwaukee is such an incredibly unique place to call home.
Thank you once again for strongly considering me as a potential candidate to be a Host for Your Upcoming Television Show Selling Milwaukee! I am looking forward to be an extension to your vision, since part of your vision is what I already do on a monthly basis at a local level.
Cheers!

I am a 2+.  I would be closer to a 3, but funds are tight and I need to look at the fiscal feasibility of doing this.  

I googled the names on the Zoom with me and only saw three other Madison area Realtors. I do like that there are not a whole lot of Madison area realtors who would be in competition.

Questions:

1) How many Realtors from each area would be allowed to ""buy in""?

2)  Will I have a segment every other month, regardless of how many agents do segments?

3)  Once I leave the program, can I still use my segments, etc?

Additionally, I wasn't expecting a set up fee of $1500. If I tried this for a couple of months and found it wasn't for me, that would be $1500 wasted. However, if it was a sure thing, the cost wouldn't be as much of a concern. 

These two factors are currently holding me back. 

 The fee of $1100 a month isn't bad if it's monthly, but since it's every other month, it amounts to about $2200 per segment, which is quite steep. 

 For now, I'm going to hold off.

And am not opposed to anyone finding a way to make a living. 1k is a bit high to pay for something we can do ourselves. I think it’s a good idea just wrong approach and wrong experience level regarding agents. You’ll have to find a way to make this more appealing. Also, the videos and footage we saw wasn’t great.

4/24/2024,FALSE,#3,,"5/3 I'm really on the fence about pursuing this opportunity.  Two concerns that I have are 1) the time commitment for the pre-work before the ~3 hours of shooting time (I'm a one man show and barely have enough time to do everything I have to do to keep my business rolling), and 2) I don't plan on working much longer.  I will probably retire in 1-3 years and if that happens by the time I see the benefits of this I will be on the way out.  
However, if I were ten years younger and still had 10-15 years of work in front of me, I would jump all over this opportunity because I feel like if a Realtor got involved w/ this and gave it 150% that it could propel him in his career like wildfire, but for where I am at in life I think I will have to pass.

4/11/2024,FALSE,#3,,"4/17 Thank you for the very informative zoom meeting. Did not expect it to run as long as it did and my laptop died on me because I left my charger at home😂
Having said that, I’m not trying to brag, but I was the #1 non team agent in Bay County last year, and we have 2400 agents on our board. No team, no transaction coordinator, no assistant, not taking credit for anybody else’s sales. All me 24/7. I’ve been licensed for 27 years, I am bilingual, and I’m a former Marine Corps drill instructor. I’m stating this because if anyone can afford it, I can…but $1200 a month in our small market is just way too expensive. I’m sure you can’t modify your fees to adapt to the geographical area that you are reaching out to but if you did, you would probably get a lot more agents willing to commit. This is not a big city, if this were New York, San Diego, Miami, etc, there would be many more opportunities for prospects. I spent my first six years in Miami in real estate, and I was in San Diego when I was in the Marine Corps. Stationed at Camp Pendleton,  MCRD and spent many many many weekends there. Lived between Fallbrook and Temecula. I got a giggle out of Craig referencing some small area of one of his customers and he said it was only 50,000 people. Well, we only have 35,000 year-round in Bay County. So this is minuscule. So I(unfortunately) will have to pass, but, I would love to do the show if it was financially sensible🥺🤷‍♂️",<---Clint Jordan trying to save,Agent,Panama City,Mario,Gobel,RECIPROCAL OFFICE,(850) 527-5878,gobelrealestate@gmail.com,153 - Panama City,120.00,"Wednesday, April 17th at 2pm CT/3pm ET",,,,,,,,NEW

 I extend my best wishes for your continued success. 2/28 Good afternoon, It was a pleasure meeting Craig Sewing today and learning more about the show. I am very interested in becoming a part of it, yet I do have a few questions :

- Could you kindly provide a media kit?
- I am curious about your show's demographics. Could you shed some light on the age, income, and general profile of your audience?
- Regarding the $1,200 monthly fee, when does it commence?
My expertise is in pre-construction within the Brickell/Downtown area. I'm curious if there is already an agent focusing on promoting this particular neighborhood and specialization. Given my extensive connections in Miami, I envision featuring prominent celebrities and notable French entrepreneurs on the show.

You are saying that content could be 20% Real Estate content or 100% Community content.  That, plus the fact that I googled ""where to watch The American Dream TV"" and it is clear that it does not have a clear and consistent place to watch for most viewers (and primarily relies on sphere social media). I get that the platform could be used effectively to promote oneself and the fact that they were selected to be on the show, however, the show content itself falls short for the potential viewers if it can only be 20% real estate/80% community.

I absolutely see the value in the proposition, however, I find that I'm not in a position to make full use of it - my husband is fighting stage 4 cancer right now, so, while the idea of, perhaps being considered for a one-time segment seemed interesting, and do-able right now - taking on the expense, additional social media marketing efforts, then fielding the additional business isn't a logical move for me. As things change, I hope to be in a better position at some point in the future to jump in at this level.  I would like to say - ""Bravo"" -  This business model is brilliant.   I was involved as a co-speaker and business partner in a real estate seminar business in the late 1990s.   We held meetings with agents, and conducted 2-day seminars - filled 500 seats at the Disneyland Hotel, etc.   I authored one of the first ""buyer-broker"" systems out there, and we were on the ""cutting edge"" back then, working with Superlative - a media company - to create some of the first real estate listing videos.   They were cheesy - embarrassingly so, by American Dream standards.  😊 However, for 10 easy payments of $250 and an upfront $500 on your credit card, you, too, could be on film!  Ah, the 90's.

However, just before you guys reached out to me, I made a very significant outlay for marketing/branding, as well as a new website and some other technology.  This was definitely my biggest expense since I have been doing this, so at this point, I do not want to put too much stress on myself with another monthly obligation.  The marketing/tech expense was something that was most definitely needed above anything else, so I am going to be focused on that for the next 6 months or so.

When going through the presentation, what struck me was the opportunity to highlight many of the local nonprofits.  My children (and I by proxy) are very well known in the area for a nonprofit they started 9 years, Snuggle Sacks - Resources for the Homeless.  Because of this, we have all been a part of all local chambers of commerce, community groups, economic development groups and more.  One thing we always here from those that volunteer with us specifically is that they would love to give back and be more involved in the community, but don't know where to start.  I have become quite the resource for that kind of thing already, so using a platform like this to highlight a community and the nonprofits in it, I think that would be amazing.  LIkewise, I am friends with hundreds of business owners that could be mixed in, and I could really see partnering up a business with a nonprofit on each episode to possibly raise some awareness and even funds for the better good.

My primary market is Tulsa, Oklahoma.  More specifically, I work in the Midtown/Maple Ridge/downtown areas, as well as specializing in our many incredible lakes across the northeastern and central part of the state.  I've been a realtor with Keller Williams Realty Advantage since 2002.  I grew up in Tulsa, graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Motion Picture Production (Radio/TV/Film) from the University of Oklahoma, lived in LA for a bit after that and returned to Tulsa to work in corporate video production, and marketing for Vyvx/ Williams Communications/Wiliams Energy.  I also have been a Stage Manager for sports broadcast production for ESPN, CBS Sports, etc. for over 30 years. Pretty much a sports fanatic.  I am very proud of my city of Tulsa, she has such a wonderful diversity of people, cultures, arts, music, sports and outdoor lifestyles.  A very interesting history!  And with the positive leadership of our past mayor and our new one, we continue to grow in technology and remote work opportunities.  We are the perfect blend of little and big city lifestyles.  I love to share my intense belief in, and love for, the best-kept secret city in the Midwest, and the stories I know from the early days, to the new innovations coming up.  I am so much less about promoting myself, than I am about promoting the people and places I want everyone to know about!I look forward to getting started ASAP!","1/23/25 - TD - Hi Tim, thanks for checking in.

I am 100% in and would love to be chosen as a ""host"" for the show. My primary market is Reno/Tahoe. I am a partner of the Overall and Hamilton Group and we cover all of Lake Tahoe, Minden, Gardnerville, Genoa, Carson City, Reno and Sparks. I have both my Nevada and California licenses.I would love to be a host to not only showcase the beautiful place that I get to call home, but to showcase the amazing people that live here as well. Being born and raised in this community gives me a unique insight on the history and growth of this market. I also get to see first hand the amazing people that make a difference everyday, and it would be an honor to celebrate and congratulate them with all your viewers. All in one day I could be talking to a rancher about his grass fed cattle, to having a happy hour appetizer with an Olympic skier and Microsoft tech, to donating my time coaching basketball at our local community center. Growing my business would obviously be incredible, but to do it with authenticity and enjoyment would be life changing. I value my career, the lifestyle this allows me, the people I get to interact with, and to be able to enhance all of those things by being a host on your show would be a dream. I have been in hospitality my whole working life and I live by the fact that if you are a good person, and associate with good people, good things will happen. I feel like ADTV is more than a good thing... It is a great thing! I want to share my story and give people an outlet to share theirs. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

5/29/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"Absolutely! I would love to offer a behind-the-scenes look at the vibrant events, unique neighborhoods and diverse businesses that make Nashville such an exciting place to live and visit. With the city welcoming new residents every day, I would love to showcase the hidden gems and local hotspots that newcomers (and some locals) might not yet know about, helping them to connect with their community and experience the true essence of Nashville.Here are a couple of ideas I had (really leaning into the ""sphere hacking"" that Craig mentioned on the call):Wags & Walks Nashville (58k followers) is an amazing dog rescue here that originally started in LA. Numerous celebrities like Dan & Shay, George Kittle and Chris & Lauren Lane support the charity as well. Then head on over to Rosepepper Cantina (East Nashville) for food/drinks. Rosepepper Cantina is very well known for the funny memes they put out on their sign. The Real Estate in East Nashville is also unique as a lot of people love the historic, craftsman style houses here.12 South is an amazing neighborhood that has so many cool, local shops and restaurants. There are numerous shops / things you could film here. White's Mercantile (105k followers) which is a general store that offers amazing home gifts. You also have Ranger Station that makes premium fragrances and candles (they also partner with different celebrities to create unique scents). Edleys BBQ is a great local place to stop food and could end the meal with Jeni's Ice Cream. All of these are walking distance and there is usually a flower shop, murals, etc. you can see along the way.Rustler Hat Co is a really cool company that allows you to create and completely customize your own hat. I would love to do a feature here on what all goes into making a hat. This is located in the Gulch neighborhood which is super walkable to a ton of other shops and restaurants. This is a great area to showcase cool condo buildings.Since I have a couple of contacts in the Music Industry, I would love to do a behind-the-scenes feature of music row and the big music giants since that is what a huge part of Nashville is about. Music Row connects to a ton of neighborhoods so you have diversity here with showcasing real estate.Folds of Honor is another great charity organization that I'm passionate about. They just did a celebrity softball tournament to raise money for scholarships to families of fallen or disabled service members. They usually have a celebrity golf tournament hosted at the Governors Club (Brentwood) that would be cool to film and then feature a home in that private community (pretty sure Carrie Underwood use to have a house in here).Cheekwood (111k followers) is a botanical garden in Nashville that does amazing events and installations year round. During the fall they build tiny houses made out of pumpkins which is a huge hot spot for people to go take photos. They also build a beer garden along with other things and is a great place to take the family.Arrington Vineyards is a gorgeous vineyard we have in WIlliamson County that is co-owned by country music artists, Kix Brooks. Is a gorgeous area that is perfect for picnics and listening to music.Goo Goo Cluster is a local chocolate company in Downtown Nashville. This might be a cool company to show as you can go in and make your own candy bar.I have a a couple more ideas but those are my top favorites. My previous experience as an Event Director I think will really help me create fun watch parties and get businesses involved.",,Agent,Nashville,Caroline,Keenan,"Compass Tennessee, LLC",615-686-7320,caroline.keenan@compass.com,27 - Nashville,103.00,"Thursday, June 6th at 10:00 am CDT",,,,,,,,NEW
5/29/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"As I have already shared in my DM to Craig, I moved to Nashville to do Teach For America. My wife did as well and is currently still in education serving as a Vice Principle. I still have a huge passion for the solving of the inequities that lay within our education system here. There is a Charter School here called Nashville Classical, and the founder and CEO goes by the name of Charlie Friedman. A man I look up to and also hold a close relationship with. I would love nothing more than to show case the neighborhood of East Nashville (which also happens to be where I live) and how this school is changing the lives of our kids who live here as well. Something short and quick but also very direct and to the point of how he has impacted and is continuing to impact our community on a daily basis & how others can help. I also have a huge passion on helping teachers understand and see that they can purchase a home. Something that I thought was completely out of reach, when I taught. I’d love to bring on a teacher and have her address how exciting and unbelievable it is that she was able to plant roots the community of her students. Not to mention I have a few listings coming up I can highlight.Moreover, I am a huge golfer and a member at Old Hickory Country Club. Our owner, Steve Smith, owns about 4 or 5 Honky Tonks on Broadway. I would kill to do a “life in the day” of golfing and “honky tonkying” your way through Nashville, maybe as seen through a Titans Player. I golf with Eric Decker and Brett Kern regularly and bringing in them could be a very cool way of highlighting such a huge part of what makes Nashville “Nashville” - the Titans and Broadway. I’d also like to segway it into talking about their charities they hold dear to their heart and how Nashville is made up of a group of people who GIVE. Probably one of my favorite parts of this city is the PEOPLE and how kind they are. We truly do embody the “southern culture.” Even if you are a California kid… you embrace it like it’s your own. People NEED to see that, hear it and witness it!Lastly, one of my clients (who also moved from Nashville) just opened up a coffee shop in Franklin called ""Hanks Coffee Station.” They are truly the most down to earth, most entrepreneurial, and hardest workers I know. They have created a brand in less than a year and it is popping off. Show casing the history of Franklin, the battles, the square and then transitioning it into a local couple who created something so pure and awesome. They would KILL to be on this. They already don't have enough parking and it would be incredible to partner with them.As for being a host, I hope through my email, DM and my responses above, I just truly love this town. I feel I have connected with different groups in my 7 years here all who showcase really well what this town stands for and is striving to be. I also don't want to hide that fact that this would be an incredible opportunity to continue to grow my business and share my knowledge of Nashville. Not to mention how fun it really does sound. I have found my self in every job and function I do, as a leader and spokesperson. I'd love to have this be my opportunity or a good ole “kick in the butt” to showcase everyone else what this city is all about. My clients that move here from out of state quickly realize Nashville is made up of a ton of different “boroughs” and all, have their own vibe, walkability, ease, type of people, age demographic etc etc. It's one of my favorite parts of this city.

In my previous professional life, I had the opportunity to work with many celebrities and professional football athletes in fitness as I was one of the most sought after personal trainers and grew that into owning one of the largest fitness facilities in the southeast.I shared this because I will be able to pull in guests that have a celebrity status.There are incredible towns that are a little more rural that I would love to showcase.

I try a new one every month as a way to support small businesses and explore all the different neighborhood hang spots.Another really cool Cincinnati event is called The City Flea. Once a month on a Saturday from April through October about 100 local vendors gather on the lawn at Washington Park, open air flea market style. Washington park sits in front of Music Hall and besides green space there is a dog park, kids playground, bar and splash fountains area. It attracts vendors of all kinds as well as food trucks, and is a really fun family event.My WHY is I really love Cincinnati. No one in mine or my husband's family is from the Midwest.

5/7/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"5/15 agreement f/up sent 5/14 (#1) After the nearly 3 hour Zoom meeting today I was getting ""goosebumps"" at the opportunity to be part of the show and was brainstorming several ideas for shows if accepted as one of the hosts for ""Selling Florida.""

As you may or may not know - as I mentioned to Amy in an email last week confirming today's Zoom meeting, besides selling real estate in Ft. Lauderdale/Broward County/Palm Beach County for nearly 10 years - I have dabbled in the acting/showbiz industry as well - (not that it's a prerequisite to get accepted on your Emmy nominated show) - but as you mentioned in the meeting (about throwing egos out the window) - I am about as humble as they come, absolutely no ego when mentioning my past acting experience, as we know doing scripted TV shows is apples & oranges compared to being a host on your television series, unscripted.  

Just a couple weeks ago I had a small gig in the German series, ""Das Traumschiff - as they were filming an episode in Miami Beach, as well as previous small parts in ""Burn Notice,"" ""Graceland,"" & ""Code Enforcers"" - which the pilot episode never made it to the screen - as well as local theater here in Fort Lauderdale, ""Angels In America."" 

If it is okay, before you make a final decision on who you will choose as the next Host for ""The American Dream TV - Selling Florida,"" I would like to do a small clip of a show (of course amatuer with me, myself, and I - of an idea I came up with for the first show - if accepted)?  

I will send it over in the next few days of just me touring a couple of properties at the beginning, very short - but focusing on a not so ""new"" but transitioning, ""up-and-coming"" area of Ft. Lauderdale - which a lot of locals including those in my profession of real estate don't know, but NE 13th Street will be renamed ""Studio City - which is a city project currently in the works with a collective array of businesses, such as restaurants, galleries, gyms, bakeries, barber shops, ect.

People travel from all over the world just to tour the stadium, seriously.My Partner being a football fanatic does tours on Saturday only, so what a great way to showcase Arrowhead with the odds on the Kansas City Chiefs winning yet another Super Bowl in the upcoming season.IDEA #2 idea is the World War 1 Museum, here in Kansas City, I believe this and maybe one more are the only museums of this type in the country.  But the cool factor about the underground museum is at the very top, you can see amazing 360 views of the city, as if you were in a bird's nest up there. ( See attached)IDEA 3.

4/9/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"4/19 - in terms of ideas - I'm a big fan of story telling and drawing people in both from an emotional standpoint, but also from an inspirational one.  I love that the goal for the show is to be uplifting, and so as I've thought through this preliminarily, I think I'd like to try to share my story and help people learn about me in a thoughtful and really deliberate way - show by show, while also weaving that story in to Colorado and my career as a real estate agent.For example, I'd envision maybe my first segment being about how and why I ended up in Colorado and in Louisville in particular:  My husband and I were living in the Bay Area with a baby on the way.  I'm from Maine.  My husband is from Wisconsin and we come from places centered on really strong communities and sense of belonging.  I also had just retired from being a professional athlete and both my husband and I are avid cyclists, runners, skiers, etc and so one of our key criteria for the place we moved to was to be in a culture where people truly embrace and prioritize being outside.  We also wanted to be in a place where we could have that access to nature and outdoors, yet still be close to a city or urban environment.  And for us - Boulder County (and ultimately Louisville) really fit all of that.From there I'd want to showcase and talk about WHY we love Louisville - how community centered it is, the weekly farmer's markets, Friday street fairs, the amazing restaurants, the frequent parades, the amazing library and community center and tons of parks and open space and trails....and the neighbors who are SO friendly.  AND we are 25 minutes to Denver and 10-15 minutes to Boulder.  And that Louisville, despite being so close to Boulder, has a much lower and more affordable price pointFor another episode I'd talk about how running and riding for me is what recharges me and re-fills my cup and how there are SO many trails in Boulder County and in the front range, it is just so exciting to constantly be exploring someplace new....so we could go on a trail run together or maybe show some of my top picks for trail runs....and then potentially show a house or neighborhood that is close to some of my favorite trails.The point is that I'd want to continually build on and share how living in Boulder County and Colorado impacts me...share my story...and tie real estate into that in a subtle but really beautiful way.  I like to pull heart strings a bit - I want people to connect and relate to me and my story....and then from there also showcase my professionalism, knowledge of the area and my willingness to hustle.My WHY is a few fold:  I love storytelling and inspiring people to dream and believe in going after something, and I think this is a pretty affordable vehicle for me to be able to push out content that is professionally produced and edited.  and also - I have BIG goals for myself and my business.

4/4/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"4/4 invited to QA 4/4 I appreciate the opportunity to potentially collaborate and, after careful consideration, I’m leaning towards option #2. I’m genuinely interested and have a couple of ideas that I believe could benefit both our brands significantly.

Given the entrusted role by Ryan Serhant to spearhead the SERHANT. brand’s growth in Orlando, I’m particularly excited about the possibilities that align with the format of your show. My primary thought revolves around securing multiple slots within your episodes to feature various SERHANT. Orlando agents. This flexibility would allow us to rotate agents, showcasing a diverse array of Orlando’s real estate offerings, lifestyles, and personal agent highlights.

Additionally, I’m intrigued by the possibility of dedicating a full episode to our SERHANT. Orlando agents. If feasible, this could be a fantastic way to provide a deeper dive into the Orlando market from multiple perspectives, all within the SERHANT. framework. This idea might be ambitious, but I believe it has the potential to create engaging content that would be beneficial for American Dream TV and a great showcase for SERHANT. as a brand.

I’m looking forward to discussing these ideas further and exploring how we might integrate them into your programming for mutual benefit.","Serhant Agent, treat like VIP!",Agent,Orlando,Mark ,Raumaker,Homesquad - Serhant,(347) 368-9140,mark@serhant.com,17 - Orlando-Daytona Beach-Melbourne,,,,,,,,,,NEW

3/26/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"4/3 - To answer the first question….YES.  Did you know that Hershey (yes, that yummy chocolate company) is in my back yard?  And….there is SO much there to talk about and do.  We could do tons on that alone.  Harrisburg is also Pennsylvania’s capitol (rich with history).  We have the Carlisle Barricks…the town is one of my favorites.  We also have ‘apple country’ just south of me.  I live on the edge of Lancaster (which is really another ‘market’, but it offers a large Amish population (another neat tourist thing peeps like to do).  Harrisburg has its own football team (a client of mine is the GM there) and a baseball team (one of the owners is a friend of mine).  We have the Hershey Bears (hockey) and I love our local music scene!  I am also very involved in LLS, ACS as well as a few other charitable organizations that would be great to highlight when they have events.  Besides all that…you can’t miss out on all the local fairs, art fest, apple festivals and more!  Okay….is that enough to start?The second questions….two reasons.  One, I wanted to do something very similar a few years back.  At the time, I was going to call it ‘Behind the Sale’ where I focused on my client’s business/charities and so forth.  The concept was great, however, getting it off the ground...well…I didn’t. It felt so overwhelming to ‘figure out all the tech side’.   Second, I’m 54.  I’ve been a realtor since I was 25.  When I started, I was introduced to Mike Ferry…so, I was taught to pick up the phones and prospect, prospect, prospect.  So, when social/internet marketing came around, I stayed clear of it.  I’m behind the curve and I KNOW that that needs to change.  I’ve been wanting to do something BIG and I believe I don’t just have the personality and the knowledge of my area to do it, but I have the drive to succeed at it.

Yes, I am very passionate about being a part of American Dream TV, and everything it can do for my neighborhood, culture, and my real estate life. I have a couple of ideas for some segments already cooking in my mind. We have a new establishment that just opened last weekend that I would love to visit and do a showcase on. It's called Sinclair Social (it's a combination food truck lot and open air bar/dining garden), and it's such a great spot in our community. It's on the same block of our Downtown Farmer's Market which opens back up in May. I have a segment in mind where we can showcase the farmer's market while talking to the vendors that are there or I know some local business owners that frequently visit the market. One of these local business owners is Christa Morphis and she owns Model City Insurance. Christa and I can walk and talk about what services that she provides to the community while experiencing the farmers market. I would like to center some segments around Anniston's Main Street, and these two locations are one of many that we can enjoy. We can also end the segment with visiting one of the listings that I have here in Anniston or just center this episode around the lifestyle in Anniston.3/21 - Thank you for the invite!!

Rodney Scott of the Food Network has partnered with some dear friends in the Pahakis Food Group to open more of his restaurants here as that food group continues to grow.We are a community made of LOCAL. We have amazing local art, music, breweries, grass roots groups for any and every cause you can imagine - even a much more diverse demographic than many are aware.We have a LOYAL and DEDICATED sports following - our Barons (baseball), Legion (USL soccer), Stallions (USFL football) and Squadron (basketball) - and seeing our town - especially young families with kids who are so die hard - is really special. As I was born and raised in Atlanta with so many options (huge Hawks fan and knew every Braves stat from ‘84-‘87) it is absolutely awesome to see this culture here!Our music scene is insane - and despite sitting between Atlanta and Nashville - we continue to birth some of the world’s most talented artists and host the others - even luring my favorite, the Foo Fighters, every couple of years!I want to incorporate all we offer - you guys won’t believe our state parks and trails that are available here. So many friends are really big mountain and trail bikers and it is really cool to see that community grow.Additionally, we have a HUGE fitness community. Our topography lends to some seriously difficult road races (please look up Statue to Statue - a race that we did twice and swore never again!) and the history of the Mercedes Marathon here in our town.I’m working on pairing different venues, communities and such together for episodes but want to feature my amazing community, Homewood, early on!  It is like Mayberry - and has so much to offer. We have some amazing local entrepreneurs here whom I would really like to feature - Twin Construction - kids I grew up with in ATL who have built one of the most successful building companies in the south - our good friend Jason Malone, who built Good People Brewing Co. and now also runs Avondale- which is an insanely popular local brewery featuring huge national music acts from all over.I also can’t wait to feature the Barons, with my friend Jonathan Nelson at the helm - and under new ownership this season -  and the Legion (really where my sports allegiance lies here in town - though I identify as an ATL United fan!) They are sincerely doing the hard work to keep the smaller stadiums full and to keep Birmingham so engaged in our hometown teams.My segment ideas really revolve around demonstrating all that Bham has to offer - to walk people through the different neighborhoods, different hang out, different unique features of our town, some of which I have mentioned above, and to really FEATURE our town!  I am excited for people to know what a beautiful home we have!With a master’s degree in communication and a PR background, 6 years in real estate, a 15 year long tenure at our local YMCA, and years and years of family traditions and relationships here in Birmingham, I cannot imagine a better host!I can sincerely say that relationships and honesty are my focus and the rest comes naturally, as a result.

I'm biased because my boy plays for Hoover and I too am a graduate of Hoover High, class of 06. Go bucs! Hoover was on two-a-days for MTV for their fantastic football program, and the drumline in the band is electric. A line up of the band playing leading a home game as we do parades before each game can be pretty powerful, before you see a true classic Friday Night Lights episode in probably the best stadium to play high school football.

Naturally, I am a connector and enjoy very much putting a spot light on the underdogs and those small businesses that make up the backbone of our community. I thrive on that connection and teaching people how to use real-estate to accomplish their dreams by leveraging their assets to become passive income assets in ways to rent, airbnb, or multi-family.There's so much more to the American Dream besides taking that first step in owning a house, but rather, owning a house that pays you to own it.

From iconic sites like Rickwood Field, the oldest baseball park in the nation, to the majestic Vulcan statue overlooking our city, Birmingham is steeped in fascinating stories waiting to be told.I envision hosting a TV show that combines the exploration of Birmingham's historical landmarks with personal anecdotes from my own upbringing in the city. By weaving together the narrative of Birmingham's past with my unique perspective and experiences, we can offer viewers a multifaceted journey through time.Here's a glimpse of what the show could entail:1. Historical Exploration: Each episode would focus on a different aspect of Birmingham's history, highlighting landmarks such as Rickwood Field, the Birmingham Black Barons' original home, to the ""heaviest corner on earth."" Through on-site visits and interviews with local historians, we would uncover the stories behind these iconic sites.2. Personal Reflections: Interspersed throughout the show would be personal anecdotes from my own life, offering viewers insight into the experiences and challenges faced by a Birmingham native. From growing up in a single-parent household to navigating the complexities of our city's culture, these reflections would add depth and authenticity to the narrative.3. Community Engagement: The show would actively involve the Birmingham community, inviting residents to share their own stories and memories of the city. Through interviews, events, and social media engagement, we would foster a sense of connection and camaraderie among viewers.4.

3/6/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"3/14 #1 I am 100% in and here is so more info about me.  RS Lead

 I have been in the business for 25 years. I started in the mortgage business first and after 8 years open my own mortgage company and ran that for about 6 years until the crash in 2009. After about 14 years in the mortgage business, I then got my real estate license and then my broker license and now I own USA#1 Realty and have 6 agents.

 I still write about 35 to 40 mortgages a year and I am so knowledge with every program out there. I also just started getting in to commercial lending this past year and I have now sold 2 bars and a few other commercial properties in the last few years.

 The last few years I have been in the Top 100 agents in my County and received an award from Real Producers for this last year for real estate and I now do much more real estate then mortgage.

I also just received my Manufactured home dealer license last year as I am now the sales manager for manufactured home community and have about 20 current listings.

I am also a veteran and served in the Marine Corp for 14 years.

My market is Detroit Michigan area but I live on one of the Great Lakes 25 minutes north of Detroit in probably one of the nicest waterfront neighborhoods in the area so I specialize in Waterfront homes not homes directly in the City of Detroit. 

I also have been watching and following NREP episodes and Barry Habib the last 10 years.

I have a lot of ideas for the show. I spent about 4 hours last night watching many of your past episodes and think I would be a great fit for your show too.

The Reno-Tahoe Area is home to many prestigious and desired events which bring in hundreds of thousands of Visitors to the region.

Some of the events that occur annually in the region include Street Vibrations, Hot August Nights, Carson Valley Days, Candy Dance, Reno Rodeo and the Great Balloon Races just to name a few.  I feel there is a plethora of opportunities to showcase these events for both local residents and the people looking to move to NV which continues to be one of the fastest growing areas nationwide.What is your WHY behind being a host? As a Native Nevadan, I have an obligation to be a good steward of the state and have dedicated my life as a public servant.

1/9/2024,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"1/17 I am 100% your American Dream Santa Barbara Newest Host. What makes me unique and interesting? I am living beyond my wildest dream here in California selling multimillion dollar real estate. A mear six years ago I was a struggling high school teacher in the midwest (Arkansas) making $60,000 a year after 20 years in education and multiple challenging life setbacks (my own Netflix special) I hit the reset button on my life, quit my job, sold everythng, bought an RV and moved to my dream location of Santa Barbara. With 20k in my pocket and a life style dream, my wife and I started a senior downsizing company to help seniors move out of their enormous homes into lovely senior retirement campuses. Our business morphed into now an A-Z one stop shop for everything senior from downsizing, estate sales, and now real estate.The first year in the business I sold 7M, second year 17M, and this year I am heading to 30M as our goal. It is not about the money, its about the impact we are making on a vunerable community in trouble. Wealth and Health are intertwinned issues within our community and we see the best and worst of poor retirement planning and trying to age in place in huge homes that over run peoples lives. Hence, why our senior business is called SB SOS! Clever girls...We lived full time in our RV for 5 years and saved a pile of cash to buy a slip and 42"" boat and now on our yaght at the Santa Barbara harbor with our cat, Mr Black Cat. It's kind of a cool story, you can ask me later about living in an RV in Santa Barbara and selling million dollar homes. (only my broker knew the truth).https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTKvEuskxo1mfdzbNPC13Aw Fast forward three years, my wife co-founder of SB SOS with me have leaped out of no where into the top 1% of luxury realtors in this town. This is an unbelienvable feat for two women restarting their lives at 50 in this town. We are humble and extrememly grateful to God for the opportunities infront of us and continue to give back to our community. My wife and I see The American Dream TV show as an incredable lever to dynamically speak about senior luxury real estate and why people stay in this community as a longivity life style. It is not uncommon for us to be working with 85-90 year old elders who are traveling the world and using Santa Barbara as their homebase even after I sell their home. Kelsey and her crew moves our clients into one of the amazing senior retirement communities Santa Barbara and Montecito Santa Barbara Senior LifeStyle. We (SBSOS) have moved and sold real estate with NASA rocket designers who sent man to the moon, world famous surgeons, CEO's of car companies, attorney's to presidents, and on and on. We are privilaged to work with the most fasinating people you could imagine and they all have a story or two to tell. The most enjoyable part of my day is coffee and couch chats while allowing people to share their stories. I see this an awesome platform to showcase fantastic seniors who are selling their muli milion dollar properties with me and living life to its fullest - downsized and comfortable, with no more maintenace or home ownership strings. Now that is a fun story to tell. I sell real estate primarily in the Montecito, Santa Barbara, and Goleta areas. My market space is very tight as I spend alot of time with my clients one on one and love hearing their stories, sometimes we are the first people to sit down and actually ask them about their lives, most people just want to know how they made their money. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of something very special and exciting. My mind is spinning with ideas to showcase our SB community, arts, culture, music scene, food, sports, schools, voluntarism at its best, the harbor, sailing, the fishing industry and of course some gorgeous real estate. As a bonus I would love to get us to the table with to compete for more listings. I have some pretty tough company in this town, and it is very thin air in the 5M and up market. However, we have broken the ceiling twice in that space and are at the table for an 8M plus listing this spring. I sure would love to launch my first episode of American Dream TV featuring his spectacular property designed by a world-famous architect.Looking forward to hearing from you and your team. I am completing the initial paperwork tonight for my full commitment to compete for a slot as one of your new American Dream TV hosts here in Santa Barbara.

12/5/2023,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"12/16 - Modesto Mchenry Mansion My Why, First off this was an idea that was born for me back in 2018 when I had the idea to promote local businesses as a way of providing value to my sphere as well as being an ambassador for the community that I live in.  I was doing interviews with local companies and posting that video content on Social Media.  I even participated in a program called “LoLo” that was giving my clients a monthly gift to local vendors and then I would interview those vendors to support not only the monthly gift idea but to again also promote their companies. I did this for about a total of 2 years then COVID hit.  Fast forward to this opportunity and it is very much in alignment but now on Steroids!!  I see the incredible potential to advocate for my community, be a resource of expertise of all the amazing reasons to live in this area and that of course ties into Real Estate which I know you know!  I was on the Gallo Winery Relocation team for a few years as well, and that also part of my experience in advocating for the lifestyle of our area as I toured candidates from around the country in our area to show them why living here is so wonderful.My second why is I love to serve and give back.  This is my “why” for my passion in Real Estate and to have an opportunity to expand that into this arena is so powerful to me personally.  To uplift others, promote them, or simply learn more about them - to be a “go giver” has transformed not only my business but my life.  To have the opportunity to participate on a level at this incredible caliber would be transformational personally and then the icing on the cake would be the professional benefit.  The doors it would open professionally is certainly obvious to me, but that is not what inspires me.  What inspires me is to share the “light” that is in me to others.",,Agent,Modesto,Joyce,Fritz,12 Doors Real Estate,(209) 479-3432,joyce@12doorsrealestate.com,20 - Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto,$8.00,"Thursday, December 14th at 1:00pm Pacific Time",Kimpton Sawyer Hotel,500 J St,Sacramento,CA,,Maple Suite ,,NEW

The Victorian Christmas in Nevada City, an old Gold Rush Town.Fun peeks at special eateries, bakeries, and coffee shops in and around all the Gold-rush era, destination towns of  Penryn, Newcastle, Auburn, Grass Valley, Colfax, Nevada City.Did I mention this is wine country? Placer County promotes  a well established  Wine Trail that is a destination spot for hundreds of thousands of people. The area's award winning wines are no joke and some wineries have caves! (Go to https://placerwine.com.)The newest winery being built will be one of our first spots. The Project 8 winery ( Lecavalier) is under construction and boasts a 75 foot tasting tower that gradually revolves  360 degrees providing views of the Sierra Nevadas, Bay Area peaks, and downtown Sacramento. Their much anticipated tasting room will be completed in Feb. 2024.Coming up fast behind all the wineries  are breweries with hand-crafted brews  including some with mandarin flavors, making this area a  preferred destination for many from the Bay Area.Placer County, with towns like Granite Bay and Loomis,  has the most expensive and spectacular homes in all of the Greater Sacramento area. This is where the Sacramento Kings players purchase their homes and frankly many CEOs have primary or secondary homes here. The proximity to Folsom Lake, unparalleled views of the Sierra Nevadas and foothills, and extraordinary schools are our biggest draw. The other big draw is we are midway from San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. Two hours or less each way.More  content ideas are schools that take it to the next level, outdoor education sites, extraordinary or historical Air B and B's, latest wedding venues, cute animal farms (have you seen a baby alpaca up close?) or specialized rescues and anything pertaining to the Gold Rush era. Literally our area is a ""Gold Mine"" of content!You asked why we are interested in being hosts? First of all it is an extension of what we already do as we are huge advocates for our area; we are former educators and know the best schools, and know how to articulate the value of Foothill Living at its finest!   We are avid outdoor enthusiasts and LOVE telling people the many reasons they need to get out, move around and explore!  And being entrepreneurs ourselves we love promoting our local businesses that give back to our communities in so many ways.

12/5/2023,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"12/15 - I'll answer the second bullet point first, which is my why behind wanting to be a host. I've followed Shannon Gillette for a while and I've always loved the idea of lifestyle marketing. I have tried soooo many times to have videographers grasp this concept with our existing marketing. It's just never truly resonated with them. When I saw the opportunity to be a host just like Shannon, I felt like this was exactly what I was looking for. I've been seeking an avenue that would next level my almost 10 year career, and I very much see the value in investing in this opportunity.For me, scalability is a must in this business in order to create a better balance between being a mom, wife,and business owner.I started this business as a single mother and scaled it just enough to retire my now husband from the blue collared workforce. He and I now run a small local team with 2 office locations. There's a ceiling that currently exists that isn't easily broken. I know that just past that ceiling is a better life for me and my 3 children. One where they can gain more quality time back with their mom, who seems to be running, running, running, non-stop.There wasn't any hesitation in my mind to go all in on this. While I know the monthly commitment won't be easy, I will without a doubt make it happen.As far as cool ideas go, I'm native to the idaho falls area but now live in the mountains of Pocatello. I've operated my business in most if not all the main counties within Southeast Idaho and I can tell you there are some amazing hidden gems that only the most local of locals would ever know about. While I certainly hate to ""spill the beans"" on national television, it would be a tremendous selling point to showcase some of the smaller hotsprings, hiking trails, and even 5-star restaurants that are hidden in towns as small as  100 people. As wild as that sounds, there are incredible destinations that absolutely won't pop up when you google ""top 10 places to visit in Idaho Falls"".To be able to be the expert or go to resource for all things Idaho would be so fun.If I were able to move onto the next stages, I'm sure we could brainstorm something fun and unique.

12/4/2023,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"12/13 - Yes, I would love to see this be a long term thing for us, I own the state of Idaho and opening up into Utah so I could help with other markets as well.As the broker I have builders, developers and relationships with other long time businesses and short term businesses here in Southeast Idaho. I would love to showcase the Old Idaho Life and the Post Covid Idaho Life. One of my agents is the contractor for the Downtown Idaho Falls revival efforts and are doing great things with Downtown Idaho Falls. My agents Brandon and Jessica Desfosses can do very similar things in Pocatello. Our office is in downtown Pocatello. We want to focus heavily on the lifestyle, businesses and people who run them as well as help people understand the major growth that is happening here in our small communities.I am an example of the American Dream in action as a first generation American. I want to share how great our communities and people are here in Southeast Idaho. I want to showcase the people and businesses that have been around for decades as well as the people who have migrated here and brought new things for our towns. One of my agents ran a scuba dive shop in the bay area and now they opened one here in Idaho with a swimming pool to teach scuba diving. Between the scenery, recreation and the people here there is plenty of captivating content to produce and I feel a strong connection with my community and feel I can tell the story like nobody else can. I'm a natural at this and I think we could only be scratching the surface to the great content we can produce together. At 38 I am the youngest broker owner in my area and have built the 3rd largest brokerage in Southeast Idaho in just 5 years.

12/4/2023,FALSE,,Agreement IN,"12/13 - As our main marketer and content creator, I (Jess) am always looking for and thinking of ideas that will be of value to our target audience. Craig was speaking my language today when he was saying that the segments should not feel like an infomercial or be self promoting. I think if you take a look at our social media (@idahomerealestate and @heypoky), you can see that we focus on providing value rather than just talking about ourselves and our production numbers. I feel we really see eye to eye on this. You can't just spew real estate all the time, people will get bored. 80/20 rule.A couple quick ideas for segments:-A tour of Idaho State University's football mini dome and an interview with the head coach. (Pocatello, ID)-Skiing at the local ski hill (Pebble Creek in Inkom, ID)-Spend a day in the tiny quaint town of Lava Hot Springs, ID (where we own a cabin and spend a lot of time in the winter)-Highlight family activities like hiking/biking/boating/hunting/snowmobiling/4 wheeling (We have a big outdoor recreation, family orientated population here)-Finding the best burgers/tacos/beer in town.-Processing potatoes from a potato field and interviewing the farmer. (McDonald's gets their french fries from a farm 15 minutes away in American Falls, ID)-Showcase a Pow Wow on the neighboring Native American Reservation and interview a leader in the tribe (Fort Hall, ID)-Local business interviews (We also own a restaurant and are highly invested in seeing local business thrive)-We flip a lot of houses. I think it would be entertaining to do an MTV Cribs style segment with a flip that we haven't fixed up yet.Our WHY to being hosts:To be honest, we already see ourselves as hosts. We really love where we live. It is such a hidden gem in the North West. Despite this, we hear too often that there is ""nothing to do here"". So we really take the time to dive into the community and share activities, events, how to keep kids entertained, find joy in a slower pace of life, etc. These are things we are already regularly showcasing on social media because we are so passionate about it. There is so much to do here, the problem is that generally people don't know where to look! We have always been movers and shakers in our community and having this opportunity would help us reach more and do more!One more thing that we are really passionate about...We host 2 local fundraisers every year. One at halloween called ""Haunting for Hunger"". We are known for our display of giant 12 foot skeletons. People come take photos with the skellys and leave a can of food for the Idaho Food Bank.Another is every Christmas we sponsor 20 local kids in foster care and get them everything on their wishlist and more. We adopted our daughter out of foster care so this one hits home and we get so much support from the community. The shopping for it is a big deal and would make great TV, I'm sure.OK I will stop talking now! Tried to make it short and simple but i just couldn't!One more idea- Pocatello High School is HAUNTED!

I would love the opportunity to do a segment featuring the public safety forces I was a part of for many years, a segment at the Pro Football Hall of Fame (Possibly with Myles Garrett, Nick Chubb, or Kevin Stephanski), a segment at showcasing the Akron Rubber Ducks minor league baseball team, a segment featuring the AirBear and Akron Children’s Hospital, a segment featuring Firestone Golf Club or Glenmoor Country Club, segments featuring many of the small restaurants and community fairs in the surrounding area. I have so many ideas churning through my brain right now that I can’t even give you a tenth of them as an example.·  What is your WHY behind being a host?My “WHY” is my family. I have a wonderful partner and four amazing children and everything I do is for them. In the beginning of 2021 I lost my career in public safety due to cuts made because of COVID. I was left in a position where I didn’t know where to turn. I tried another position before entering into the mortgage industry after being prodded by my sisters who already worked in the industry. One is a realtor in Columbus, Ohio and the other is a top loan processor for CrossCountry Mortgage. Things went well at first and I made the decision to go all in on being a loan officer. I liquidated my retirement to support my start when the rates were just starting to really come up. I achieved loan officer of the year in 2022 for my branch and things looked like they were going great. As rates increased the business became harder to find; I started working to build more and more realtor relationships. Those relationships are what have allowed me to make it work up to this point. However, what I am doing currently is not at the level I want to be at for myself and my family. Prior to working in the mortgage industry, I was never there for the little league games or other important events because of my schedule. Working as a mortgage lender has allowed me to be there for everything and I will fight tooth and nail to never have to give that up. I am also the sole income source for our six person family which is extremely scary when business is slow since I’m 100% commission based. One of our children is diagnosed with autism and another with a rare neuromuscular disorder. The time, energy, and focus this requires makes it difficult to impossible for us to have a second income. They are the reason I am 100% in on this… I don’t have any other option – I CAN’T FAIL!Sent Agreement In email",Dec start,Lender,Akron/Canton,Michael,Hamilton,Cross Country Mtg,330-418-4509,michael.hamilton@ccm.com,#19 Cleveland-Akron (Canton),,"Tuesday, October 24th at 12:00 pm Eastern Time",,,,,,,,NEW

10/19/2023,,,Agreement IN,"10/24 - Thank you for confirming that you have received the signed agreement. Really appreciate that. To answer your questions:This is something that can really catapult a career, if stewarded properly. If I were to be chosen I am looking at to commit, at the very least, 12 consecutive months. Then reevaluate in December of 2024 to measure the return. I have a strong feeling that I will continue but want to reserve the right to make sure it makes sense for my business.So many ideas…My wife works for a company called Milestones. It is a non-profit organization that links children and families that have been diagnosed with autism to resources in their specific communities/schools. This is a nationally known and studied organization but still could use the press to help more families. I have placed my office in a co-working space called Co-Hatch in Ohio city. There are several non-profits and small business that are housed there. Would love to introduce these companies to the viewership and the city. Cleveland sports are amazing, fans are really die-hard and the facilities are great. It would be a ton of fun to showcase these fans to the world. Cleveland is made of cities inside of cities and each has a unique flavor. Contact the local business owners and share their stories. Showcasing each main street and the best local spots that everyone from there has heard of but no one outside of the area knows how to find. Showcasing how the Realtor community really gives back to Cleveland, our super awesome Mayor and the development that is planned for the waterfront, how Cleveland is going to become a 15-minute city, the plans the city has to make downtown more family friendly, all the uniquely Cleveland pubs and restaurants…..the list goes on and on.My why: I am a transplant to Cleveland, but I really love this city. I was born in Cincinnati and lived in Columbus for 12 years, so Ohio is home. Ohio will always be home, and all roads lead here one way or another. Cleveland and the surrounding suburbs get a bad rap if you only pass through this city because there are not flashing red signs telling you were to go. This is not an overly commercial/chain restaurant type of City so, If someone visits here I want them to know the best places to go. Cleveland is a city that takes pride in the individuality of each community and celebrates how everyone can come together to share a beer or “River Water” before a Browns game. Lets showcase that. Selfishly, I want to promote and grow my business because I am great at what I do, and I treat people with respect. I want to partner with great people to grow their brand in real estate and this seem like a stellar way to make that happen.Hope that helps!Sent Agreement In email",Dec start,Lender,Cleveland/Akron,Christian,Foote,Movement Mortgage,440-703-6266,christian.foote@movement.com,#19 Cleveland-Akron (Canton),,"Tuesday, October 24th at 12:00 pm Eastern Time",,,,,,,,NEW

December would be great for the Holiday walk (horse and buggy, caroling, all the lights on the green lit at night and a stop at Blitzens - the pop up bar that appears from Thanksgiving thru NYE.February would be a focus on our schools- some of our Kindergarten classes incorporate Forest Fridays as part of their curriculum and 2 of my children have been able to participate- they go out all year as long as the temp isn’t below a certain temp. Or we can interview some of the locals who have been inducted into the Hudson Hall of Fame and see why an education in Hudson has helped them in their adult life.June we host the Junior Invitational at The Country Club of Hudson- Ricky Fowler, Phil Mickelson, John Daly etc have played in it when they were young!

Please send me an agreement to review and sign.9/7 TD - Having grown up in the Navy family, I moved to Jacksonville at age 7 and still call it home! I have raised my now adult children here and built my real estate business. Besides the four season weather that Northeast Florida provides I love that we also have diversity in everything throughout our community from lifestyle living, housing options, scenery and economic options! I have become known as the Northeast Florida resource and share with others in my community and those moving to Jacksonville alot of what it has to offer. Jax as the native members call it is proud of the various sports, including the NFL Jacksonville Jaguars, Armada Soccer and arena and other sports facilities that draw others to our area. We have an active music, art, and even up and coming film production scene and industry. Jacksonville is filled with numerous outdoor opportunities with our parks, nature preserves, direct access to the St. Johns River and of course our beaches. The movement of Jacksonville from a city level to create economic and diverse growth opportunities for investors, individuals and industries is also helping to continue to provide for future opportunities to put Jacksonville on the map as a place to live. We are known as the ""City of Seven Bridges"" and have the largest land mass (840 sq miles) in the United States as a city.  Generally speaking you can get anywhere in Jacksonville within a 45 minute drive. Real estate over the years (I started in 2011) continues to remain a reasonably stable market. Our military, industrial, corporate, teaching facilities (medical and educational) along with the economic growth of Jacksonville continues to help also provide for that stability. We have iconic historic, rural, urban and suburban areas, and the continual demand for waterfront property options have continued to help grow our market. In addition to Jacksonville, our St. Augustine area is highly known as a historic area. While not considered a true part of Jacksonville most of our community ""secretly"" considers it to be a part of it. I appreciate this opportunity and that you reached out and hope to help highlight my hometown Jacksonville, FL!",,Realtor,Jacksonville,Tracy,Williams,Tracy M Williams Llc,904-463-6001,tracy.wargroup@gmail.com,#43 Jacksonville,$9.00,"Wednesday, September 13th at 2:30pm Eastern Time",CITYZOOM,,,,,,,NEW

Every Saturday, you will find all kinds of treasures there, such as: local honey, homemade soap, arts & crafts, live music, fair foods & as I already mentioned, bottlenose dolphin sightings. There are plenty of options to choose from if you would like to film the upscale shops & dining at St. Johns Town Center. It would be nice to honor our men & women in uniform by showcasing how Jacksonville is home to thousands of active duty & reserve military.

I was asking about content because I already had a cool idea.  My office is based out of Arlington Heights.  As I'm sure you know, the Bears will be building their new stadium.  I'm friends with the McCaskey family and I was thinking it may be really cool to have a sit down with them about the plans and what it will do for the community.  We feel like a lot of players will move out this way, probably in the Inverness and Barrington area where they can get their monster houses and land for privacy (and have a little distance from the stadium). Anyway, pick me! Lol 😉 Hope to hear from you soon,Laura4/6 TD - I have lived in this areas since I was 5 years old. I actually reside in the samw neighborhood i grew up in as a child. Prior to getting into real estate, I was a teacher in the community. Im very social and outgoing and actively involved in my kids school, sports activities, and charities. I like to get to know the local businesses and feature them at client events, closing gifts, and mailers. I sponsor kids sports teams, and my clients fundraising events. I love where I live, I love meeting new people, and I love to be busy. I’m never at a loss for words! My manager and founder say I have the “gift of gab” which has taken me far quickly. Hopefully, you would find me entertaining, too! Looking forward to the zoom!

After conducting further research into the nature of the project, I have come to the conclusion that it does not align with my professional values and goals.

I want to thank you for considering me for the opportunity to participate in your reality-based real estate television show and for extending an invitation to the upcoming interview. I appreciate the time and effort your team has invested in reaching out to me. After conducting further research into the nature of the project, I have come to the conclusion that it does not align with my professional values and goals. Specifically, I have noted concerns regarding elements that appear to be more aligned with a ""pay-to-play"" model or similar practices, which do not reflect the genuine opportunities I prioritize in my career. While I respect the vision behind your project, I have decided to withdraw from the interview process. I believe it is important to maintain transparency and integrity in any potential collaborations, and this opportunity no longer feels like the right fit for me.

I was born, raised and work in the western suburbs of Chicago.  I have been a real estate agent for the past 18 years and I run a team with my husband Mark.

I am thrilled about the opportunity to be a host on American Dream TV, as it perfectly aligns with how I’ve built my real estate business/team and embodies our motto, ""Give Where You Live.  I am confident that this would be a fun and exciting way to enhance community relationships while showcasing the vibrant and diverse neighborhoods that make the western suburbs unique! We have created numerous business and community videos to support local charities and businesses, but by aligning my team with American Dream TV, I believe we can exponentially increase our impact on the western suburbs.

I would love that opportunity to bring awareness to the group we donate to.Through our real estate development endeavors, our rental properties, our six brick and mortar businesses, the one thing that we continue to learn at every new level of life, is that who you are to your core, has to be so firmly planted and grounded.

Feature Midtown as a neighborhood, which is where I live and do a lot of work. It's super hip and has tons of great restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. Some good friends of mine are opening a new brewery/restaurant in March/April and I would do an interview with them in the new space.2. Try to get an interview with the president of UNR. I have a client who works in the Provost's office so I am hoping he could help facilitate that. The university is really growing and they have a new 5yr vision that they have been talking about to make Reno a true university town. I would love to talk to him more about that and showcase the campus.3. Interview the CEO of the NV Museum of Art, David Walker, in downtown Reno. They are doing a huge expansion that is really exciting and he could talk more about that.4. Talk more about Reno's amazing art scene: A tour of the murals in Midtown, tour of the large Burning Man art installations that are all over downtown, feature the Generator: a maker space that works with Burning Man to create a lot of local art that is seen at the event.5. Reno has some great festivals that are centered downtown throughout the year: Riverfest (kayaking), Hot August Nights (classic cars), ArtTown (all of July), Italian Festival, etc.6. Focus an episode on Reno as an adventure/outdoor enthusiast location and show how easy it is to do things like ski/golf in the same day. We are only 45min to Tahoe, tons of hiking/biking, etc.On why I want to be a host...I have been in real estate now for 20yrs. Which is crazy when I think about it! My firm used to have a monthly real estate TV show that I would co-host from time to time. It was very simple and a little cheesy, but it was fun. I love the idea of being a part of ADTV, that is infinite levels above that. It's easy for me to sell Reno as a great place to live and this seems like a wonderful way to help me do that. Every town has a story to tell about the things that exist within it. I feel like I have relationships with a lot of locals who can help me tell that story. As a host, this will give me the opportunity to further showcase why Reno is an incredible place to live/work/play/adventure and why I am the Realtor to help them make the move.1/23 - f/up text",,Agent,Reno,Samantha,Reveley,Dickson Realty - Downtown,(775) 250-7789,sreveley@dicksonrealty.com,102 - Reno,3.00,"Tuesday, January 23rd at 11:00 am Pacific Time",,,,,,,,NEW

9/22/2023,,,Following up,WL Dec 10/2 Joan email,"Referred by Denise Schroder - I'm a Native Tulsan and live in Midtown myself. I've been in real estate for almost 11 years now. As a Midtowner, I'm deeply involved in local businesses, including restaurants, bars, voting rights, city ordinances, and more. One of the main things to love about Tulsa is the excellent locally-owned restaurants. I keep a revolving and unique list of the trendiest places to eat, from old staples to new and trending, and from low-end to high-end. I'm known to my clients and friends as the one to go to for a recommendation for dinner for any occasion and have detailed suggestions depending on the occasion, lifestyle, or budget. More importantly, I have the pleasure of helping dozens of Tulsa Remote clients move to our area yearly. When you combine the number of houses we sell each year with my local expertise and diversity of clientele, I'm very well-versed in all things Tulsa. I just recently filmed a TV episode for NAR that featured me, a gay man, and my client, an African-American single woman, and we focused on the history of the Greenwood district and the Tulsa Race Massacre. The director, who flew in from New York to film us for 3 days, told me: ""This is a big deal. When people think of Tulsa, they don't think of a gay man with beautiful art on his nails (I use a local nail artist) and a single black woman working together in a real estate transaction. Showcasing this side of Tulsa will be very impactful, and we are so excited."" My sole mission is to educate and empower others to make informed and confident decisions. This has propelled me to the top 1% in the region and the #3 REMAX team in the state. By focusing on genuinely helping people and being a welcoming beacon to Tulsa, I can serve the community in a rich and fulfilling way. Tulsa has grown significantly over the last 5, 10, and 20 years. And we are growing at a rapid rate. This growth includes a mass movement of people moving to Tulsa/Oklahoma from out of state. This is bringing a lot more diversity to our area, and I have the knowledge, expertise, and community involvement to really showcase what Tulsa is, where we've come from, and the bright future we have in store.",Agent,"Tulsa, OK, Greater Tulsa / Green Country, Midtown Tulsa",Brett,Friesen,,918-955-8336,brett@brettsellstulsa.com,#61 Tulsa,"$31,000,000.00",9/29/2023,Dragnet,,,,,,,NEW
