I blogged for at least 15 years doing exactly what you preach, but now everyone is doing it (on Social) so it lost its appeal.  So your timing is good.  There are so much more important things in SF other than homes and I get sick watching all the real estate content realtors crank out every day.  One Reel a month suits my schedule. ;-) -It is important to note I am not your typical realtor.  I do not subscribe to that notion.  Fancy cars and image mean nothing to me.  I donate 1% of my commissions to environmental orgs (you've heard of 1% for the Planet).  I want to be successful for my family, and ultimately I want to surround myself with great people who help me live my dream of working less and playing more. There are countless angles for content here in SF and I want it to be about our city, the things you can do here that are not ""city"", the people, and the climate much more than I want it to be about me.  My question, you mentioned it's a $1200/mo buy in, which is fine, but I know you guys have to have an exit like HGTV in mind, and the reason I never once...not once, bought a Zillow ad was because I knew they were making millions, now billions off of us Realtors and our data (listings) and we got nothing in return except the ability to pay for ads so other realtors don't show on our listings which made Zillow more money.... so I never supported it.

My only question tonight is, if selected, then would we know the shooting times for April.  We will be on a week long family trip at the before of the month so don't want to miss the opportunity.  Similarly we have tripped planned in June as well.  What happens if we are unavailable during the week or day you are filming?  Just want to make sure I am fully able to take advantage of what you are offering before investing in it.

1/25/2024,TRUE,#2,,"VSA 2/1 It was a pleasure meeting you and your team and thank-you for sharing the picture of your adorable twins!  I am very interested but have a few unanswered questions and will need a few days to do my due diligence.    I have never heard of your program and most people I asked have never seen it as well.  Since it has been broadcast in New York, would you be able to tell me the viewing stats?    How are you publicizing the show so that you will increase your audience?  Can you send me some names and numbers of agents that have been on your show, including ones that started and canceled their contracts?   I was hoping to get the email with the pack of the slides, etc. so I can review.. Back to #1.  My primary geographic market is the North Shore of Long Island,  referred to as the Gold Coast.  I have been in real estate for over 50 years and have a good understanding of the areas.  I grew up and live in Great Neck, which is the first suburb out of NYC.  We are a peninsula surrounded by the Long Island sound and Manhasset Bay and have 9 incorporated villages, including Kings Point and Lake Success, where I live.  Lake Success has a private clubhouse with a catering hall and restaurant, grill room, golf course, pool, day camp, police, 18 tennis and pickle ball courts, and 6-day-a-week garbage pick up!  We are approximately 25-30 minutes by car into Manhattan, or by railroad, 30ish minutes, going to Penn Station and Grand Central Station.  We are 10 minutes from the famous American Shopping Center, which is our  version of Rodeo Drive.  I also am familiar with the Hamptons, as my family has a home in Sagaponack. In addition, my family owns a company called ""Van Wagner"" and advertises in many of the stadiums around the country and I have access to many sporting events.  One of my partners in my real estate company is Brandon Steiner (www.collectiblexchange.com) which gives us access to many sports celebrities. I can go on but I don't want to bore you anymore!   I was very impressed that you were able to do a 5-minute segment in 3 hours.  Here is a video I did of one of my listings that took me 9 hours to do a 2-minute segment.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wlGjyTPfTV3ClzhkPsLuuTekXdvRnHkq/view?usp=sharing1/31 Good afternoon!

At this point the Houston Group is very new and we are making those determinations in regard to creating the ADTV teams.I know that Jeremy is currently working on his first segment in Montrose.  There is no long term commitment, although we hope that you are with us for life!  but if you want to give it a try and see how it goes, please let us know. Thank you / Thank you for today.   Really great concept. I had an option period ending at 5 and we signed at 4.59 so I’ve had to focus on that after the call.  I also wanted to speak to Jeremy Fain who has signed up with you and I think Vicky Evans is thinking about it. To be honest,  I still wasn’t convinced it wasn’t a sales pitch (a very clever one it must be said).    I love the idea of it and can think of many stories to share so despite the fact it may be a sales pitch I can see how it’s a win win.   But I would be interested to know how you are planning on carving up Houston.   Jeremy is more Montrose.  I’d be West U.  And I gather the audience is not national but to Houston only so I was still trying to get a sense of that audience size.       I never ever jump into things this fast so if that means I miss the train then so be it.  But I did have these questions.    Thanks again Fiona 3/20 - West University is my home and the main area I work. It's a city within a city with our own city council, police and fire department. It's one of the most desirable ""cities"" in the US to live. The sense of community here is very unique and very strong. We are proud to call this little corner of the planet ours. I've lived in several countries and by far, West U beats them all. It's where neighbors look out for one another, where kids ride their bikes to their friends houses, where neighbors go out of their way to support one another (we have an amazing FB group) and where we even laugh over the odd scandal ""thong-gate"" being one - that's a story for another day. We have a resident author whose written a novel about life in West U. Being so close to the Medical Center we have ALOT of doctors. I'm not kidding when I say I could stand in the middle of the street with a medical issue and someone will know what to do! We also have so many trees we have been named tree city for many years and have our own urban forester. I've never lived anywhere quite like this and feel very fortunate to call West U home. It's the complete opposite to what people think of Houston and Texas to be. /",Agent,Houston inner loop,Fiona,Gilmour,,713-870-8532,fionagilmour@kw.com,#8 Houston,,3/24/2023,Dragnet,,,,,,,,MATCHED

I am answering with an emphatic 1 !

I’ve watched this show with my family back in 2018 and for this to come full circle to be included on this call is humbling. I’m honored that my peers have submitted my name for your consideration. 

My wheels are SPINNING because it would be incredible way to add tremendous value to my sphere. I’ve been referral based since starting in this business almost 10 years ago. We have so many incredible stories to tell here in South Florida and would love to empower my community by giving them this incredible exposure. 

Fortunately, through patience, community involvement, networking, and hard work I have been able to amass a would network of business and community leaders. 

I live in Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas where I’m lucky to bringing my biggest listing ever to market 25-28m range spec home. We are starting construction but, we can highlight the architect who has completed many great projects locally. We can do this from a boat and pull up to the docks.

Its natural beauty, friendly people, emerging food/drink scene, year-round outdoor life and philanthropic community have created a one-of-a-kind place to live.

I'm this city's biggest cheerleader and feel grateful for every opportunity to support our small businesses and people. After having my first child in 2011, I left a decade-long, passionate career in TV news and began my journey in real estate.  I created a niche as a relocation specialist and using YouTube built a successful business all based around showcasing life here in Boise. My wheels are already spinning as to what I'd feature first... the best way to spend a day in Boise, biking the Greenbelt, floating the river, skiing at Bogus or a quick day trip to Sun Valley, fly fishing on the south fork, top food, hidden gems?

This invite was definitely not some luck, but something I have manifested. I say this in particular because like Craig had mentioned I am not a social media person at all. Not because I don't think it can be an amazing addition to my business, but because the time for shooting, content, editing etc. Most agents do all the same boring things with low quality work. I mean, I tell all my clients and potential clients, I can sell Las Vegas to anyone. I have lived here 19 years now and I love it here! LV is such a unique city with so much to do that has nothing to do with the LV Strip. There are so many things I do that most locals don't know exist. I love experiencing things like comedy shows, farmers markets, symphony's, plays, Broadway shows, live music, sporting events, local activities and volunteering opportunities. So many businesses and things i want to share with everyone! The thing is I never share all the amazing things I do. I have always said I should share my life and my city, but the whole creating content, videos, etc etc has kept me from doing it. I work the Las Vegas Valley which includes Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and Henderson. I have so many ideas and thoughts in my head, as well as other agents who I think could be dynamite for the show.

Relationships are built.  And earned.  That takes time.After I left our meeting with Craig today, I attended  an RV Club Christmas Party that I helped sponsor... ( picked up a lead from an attendee, too).  I spend most of my time buying and selling homes in Active Adult Communities.  And, to that end, I get to know what makes these folks Tick.  Next Week I am going to a luncheon with the Multiple Sclerosis Charity that is hosted by the members at Sun City Lincoln Hills.  I have contributed funds to help them reach their goal. And they have asked me to speak.  (It won't be about real estate.)These communities offer pickleball, biking, hiking, softball and loads of other things that keep these folks busy.   People would be surprised to learn what actually is offered here.  55-plus folks  like everything that the younger population likes...only not quite as intense...The  ""Aging of America"" ain't what it used to be.There are  so many things that are outside of the active adult communities in the Lincoln/Roseville/Rocklin area as well..We also have wonderful restaurants, and several fabulous wineries. I have two  friends who each own a winery here locally...This would be a fabulous segment.  It would be interesting to discover how they got into the wine business, and to touch on the unique life of a winemaker.  The stunning scenery of vineyards and the countryside would be a magnificent backdrop.  My Kiwanis Club puts on a Fishing Derby for youngsters every year at a local fish hatchery.  The look on an 8 year old's face proudly  holding up a fish on the line, is priceless!  Many of these kids have never held a fishing pole, let alone touched a live fish!!There is so much more.  I would have no problem lining up interesting, vibrant segments.The reason I would like to do this?  I love people, and I care about the community around me.  It would be great fun to show them off!And, I am excited about growing my business at the same time.  I am comfortable speaking to groups and in front of a mike.This is right up my alley. I have a passion for people of all ages and a heart for my community.P.S.  Watching some of the segments you sent to me last week got me so excited because they are not hard sell.

I am very passionate about real estate. I work with my son. We have a great time and we have become very successful together. I grew up in Manhasset and went to St Paul’s in Garden City. I was lucky enough to spend my summers in Westhampton Beach. I am intimately familiar with all of these areas and I have many friends and family in all of these areas. One of the other things I am passionate about is about is the history of all these areas and what they have to offer. The island offers so much. We have 250 miles of coast line, numerous golf courses both public and private, art, theatre and so much more. All of this is just a stone’s throw away from Manhattan. I always say “why wouldn’t you want to live here”.My why is simple. I have always strived to be the best I can be. I want to raise my presence to continue our growth. I see this as an excellent way to do so. I was on another TV show in East Hampton and really enjoyed it. I don’t start things with the intention to quit.
