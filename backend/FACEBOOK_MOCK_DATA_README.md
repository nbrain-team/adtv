# Facebook Automation Mock Data

The Facebook Automation module includes comprehensive mock data for testing and development when Facebook API credentials are not configured.

## How It Works

When the environment variables `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` are not set, the system automatically switches to mock mode.

## Mock Data Includes

### 1. Mock Realtor Clients (3 total)
- **Sarah Johnson - Premier Real Estate**: Active, auto-convert enabled, $75/day budget
- **Mike Chen - Luxury Homes Specialist**: Active, manual conversion, $100/day budget

### 2. Mock Facebook Posts (15 per client)
Realistic realtor content including:
- New listing announcements
- Open house invitations

- Educational content

Each post includes:
- Realistic engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- AI quality scores (70-99)
- AI-generated improvement suggestions
- Professional real estate images from Unsplash

### 3. Mock Ad Campaigns (8 per client)
- Various objectives: REACH, TRAFFIC, ENGAGEMENT, LEAD_GENERATION
- Realistic performance metrics (CTR, CPC, ROAS)
- Different statuses: active, paused, completed, draft
- Campaign names relevant to real estate marketing

### 4. Mock Analytics
